- 👋 Hi, I’m Alan
- 👀 I’m interested in cycling, long distant hiking, coding, teaching and learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my ETL engine ETransL.  I have a wish list that I think can grow much more and would like to collaborate with others to make this happen.
- 📫 You can reach me on @chribonn, @chribonn@twit.social or on my email chribonn@duck.com

Look forward to cooperating and learning.

Take care.
